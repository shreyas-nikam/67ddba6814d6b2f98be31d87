# QuCreate Streamlit Lab: Understanding Bond Pricing and Yield Curves

This codelab guides you through a Streamlit application designed to illustrate key concepts in fixed income, specifically bond pricing and yield curve analysis. Understanding how bond prices are determined and how they relate to yield is crucial for anyone involved in finance, investment, or risk management. This application provides an interactive way to explore these concepts and observe the effects of changing market conditions.

## Introduction to Bond Pricing

Duration: 00:05

This step introduces the core concept of bond pricing. A bond's price represents its present value, derived from the future cash flows it promises (coupon payments and face value). The price is inversely related to the yield to maturity (YTM), reflecting how market expectations of interest rates impact valuation.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Key Concept:</b> Bond pricing is based on discounting future cash flows. Higher yields imply lower prices and vice versa.

## Exploring the Bond Pricing Calculator

Duration: 00:10

1.  **Navigate to the "Bond Pricing" Page:** In the sidebar on the left, select "Bond Pricing."

2.  **Understand the Input Parameters:** The page presents input fields for:

    *   **Coupon Rate:** The annual interest rate the bond pays, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    *   **Maturity (years):** The time remaining until the bond's face value is repaid.
    *   **Face Value:** The amount the bondholder will receive at maturity. This is also sometimes referred to as Par Value.
    *   **Yield to Maturity (YTM):** The total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. It is expressed as an annual rate.

3.  **Experiment with Inputs:** Change the values in the input fields. For example:

    *   Set Coupon Rate to 0.05.
    *   Set Maturity to 10 years.
    *   Set Face Value to 1000.
    *   Set YTM to 0.05.

4.  **Calculate the Bond Price:** Click the "Calculate Bond Price" button.

5.  **Observe the Result:** The calculated bond price will be displayed. Notice how, when the coupon rate equals the YTM, the bond price is close to the face value (par).

<aside class="negative">
<b>Warning:</b> The YTM significantly influences the bond price. Small changes in YTM can result in substantial price fluctuations, especially for longer-maturity bonds.

## Understanding Yield Curve Analysis

Duration: 00:15

This section focuses on understanding how bond prices react to changing yields, visualized through a yield curve.

1.  **Navigate to the "Yield Curve Analysis" Page:** In the sidebar, select "Yield Curve Analysis."

2.  **Review the Sidebar Inputs:** The sidebar allows you to adjust the following parameters:

    *   **Coupon Rate:**  The annual coupon rate of the bond.
    *   **Maturity:** The time to maturity in years.
    *   **Face Value:** The face value of the bond.
    *   **Min YTM:** The minimum YTM value to be displayed on the graph.
    *   **Max YTM:** The maximum YTM value to be displayed on the graph.

3.  **Interact with the Graph:**

    *   **Observe the Inverse Relationship:** As you increase the "Max YTM", the graph will show how the bond price decreases as the yield increases. Conversely, decreasing the "Min YTM" will demonstrate how the bond price increases as the yield decreases.
    *   **Experiment with Parameters:** Try different combinations of coupon rates, maturities, and YTM ranges to see how they affect the shape of the yield curve. Notice how longer-maturity bonds are more sensitive to YTM changes.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b>  Observe the shape of the curve. An upward-sloping yield curve generally indicates an expanding economy, while an inverted yield curve (where short-term yields are higher than long-term yields) may signal a potential recession.

## Explanation and Further Documentation

Duration: 00:05

1.  **Navigate to the "Explanation" Page:** In the sidebar, select "Explanation."

2.  **Read the Documentation:** This page provides a detailed explanation of the bond pricing formula used in the application, key concepts, and instructions for using the application. It also clarifies how the interactive visualizations are generated and their purpose. This page consolidates the conceptual information discussed so far.
